        <h3>Sort GPS Button</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>The intention of this button is to provide a sorted list of parks based on proximity to the user in ascending order. It should be used either in or very near Sarasota County Florida. It provides a rough approximation of distance from the user's current location to park location without needing cell service or wifi. This button uses GPS coordinates of your phone to calculate a straight line distance from the user's location to the park. Thus, you may notice differences between driving distance and the calculated straight line distance. For example, if you are at Bayfront Park on Longboat Key, the straight line distance to North Water Tower Park is about 5.7 miles while the driving distance is about 12 miles. This button also renders an arrow to the right of distance. The arrow shows in which direction the park is from the user's current location relative to north (top of the screen).</p>
