        <h3>About This App</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>This app is under construction. Check for updates regularly. I successfully turned it into a PWA so it can be used offline. A friend of mine inspired me to make this app. If you are in Sarasota County and need to find a public access bathroom fast, this should help.</p>

        <h3>Entry Fees</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>There was no data available on entry fees. If you would like parks removed or something indicating price of entry, please let me know.</p>

        <h3>Data Source</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>This data was obtained from <a href="https://data-sarco.opendata.arcgis.com/" target="_blank">Sarasota County GIS</a>. A big thank you goes out to Sarasota County for providing this amazing resource. If you find any errors, please let me know.</p>

        <h3>Filtering</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>When filters have been applied, if further filters are applied, they will be applied to the subset of already filtered parks. In each filter category, top of the modal, there is a result counter that shows how many parks will be displayed if the current filters are applied. The reset button on the home screen resets the filters.</p>

        <h3>Sort By Distance</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>The intention is to provide a sorted list of parks based on a rough approximation of proximity to the user without needing cell service or wifi. It should be used either in or very near Sarasota County Florida. It uses GPS coordinates of your device to calculate a straight line distance to the park. Thus, in some locations you may notice differences between driving distance and the calculated straight line distance. For example, if you are at Bayfront Park on Longboat Key, the straight line distance to North Water Tower Park is about 5.7 miles while the driving distance is about 12 miles. An arrow is also rendered next to the distance. The arrow shows in which direction the park is from the user's current location relative to north (top of the screen).</p>

        <h3>Offline Use</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>You can download this app (website) and use it offline. Not everyone has cell service or wifi so this app will help you find the nearest park without them. The first time you visit this page, you may be prompted to add it to your homescreen. You can also "install" it from the browser menu (three vertical dots on Chrome). Although the menu item reads install, it is not really a typical installation, you're just saving the webpage for offline use. To download a copy and add it to your homescreen manually on Android, using Chrome: 1) tap the three vertical dots at the top of the page; 2) at the top of the modal, tap the downward arrow with the line under it; 3) follow prompts, open it, go back to the three vertical dots, and tap on "add to home screen". The toilet icon should automatically show up as the app icon. It's a work in progress.</p>
